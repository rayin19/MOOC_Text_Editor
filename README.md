# MOOC_Text_Editor
This is a project that I made during my online course. In this project I used applet window. this is a text editor app that does various functions:
1) It can load text from any TXT file
2) It can tell the Flesch Index of the text
3) It can tell the Distance between two words
      (Distance here means the number of steps needed to reach from first word to other)
4) It can generate Markov Text(generate text with the input number of words and the generated text will be made from the text you privide it).
5) It highlights and underlines the words that are not in its dictionary.
6) It can tell spelling suggestions for these words/ add the these into the dictionary.
7) It can tell and autocomplete the words you are writing right now
